# Art Marketplace Implementation Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for transforming the OGSoft platform into a comprehensive art marketplace for various creators including artists, photographers, designers, and UI/UX professionals to display and sell their work using OG blockchain technology.

## Current System Analysis

### Strengths

1. **Blockchain Storage Integration**: The platform already has robust integration with OG blockchain for content storage via the `useUpload` hook.
2. **Database Schema**: The existing schema supports users, content, categories, and social links.
3. **Content Publishing**: The publish page allows users to upload content with metadata.
4. **User Authentication**: Wallet-based authentication is implemented.

### Challenges

1. **Content Retrieval**: Direct content retrieval from blockchain storage is challenging for preview purposes.
2. **Marketplace Features**: No purchase/sell functionality is currently implemented.
3. **Artist-specific Features**: The platform lacks specialized features for different creator types.
4. **Preview Generation**: No efficient way to generate and display previews for various content types.

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Enhanced Content Schema

Extend the existing database schema to include artist-specific metadata:

```typescript
// Add to schema.ts
export const artworkDetails = pgTable('artwork_details', {
  id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
  contentId: integer('content_id').notNull().references(() => contents.id, { onDelete: 'cascade' }),
  medium: varchar('medium', { length: 100 }),
  dimensions: varchar('dimensions', { length: 100 }),
  edition: varchar('edition', { length: 50 }),
  editionCount: integer('edition_count'),
  isOriginal: boolean('is_original').default(true),
  createdAt: timestamp('created_at').defaultNow(),
});

// Add to contents table
// - isForSale: boolean('is_for_sale').default(true),
// - saleStatus: pgEnum('sale_status', ['available', 'sold', 'reserved']),
```

### 2. Thumbnail Generation Solution

To solve the challenge of retrieving content directly from blockchain storage for previews:

1. **During Upload**: Generate and store thumbnails in a conventional database or file storage.
2. **Metadata Storage**: Store thumbnail URLs in the database for quick retrieval.
3. **Progressive Loading**: Implement progressive loading of full content only when needed.

```typescript
// Example thumbnail generation during upload
const generateThumbnail = async (file: File) => {
  if (file.type.startsWith('image/')) {
    // Create canvas and resize image for thumbnail
    const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
    canvas.width = 300;
    canvas.height = 300;
    const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    
    // Load image and draw to canvas
    const img = new Image();
    img.src = URL.createObjectURL(file);
    await new Promise(resolve => img.onload = resolve);
    
    ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0, 300, 300);
    
    // Convert to blob
    return new Promise(resolve => {
      canvas.toBlob(blob => resolve(blob), 'image/jpeg', 0.7);
    });
  }
  
  // For other file types, generate appropriate previews
  // ...
};
```

### 3. Artist Profile Page

Create a dedicated profile page for artists to showcase their work and information:

- Bio and artist statement
- Portfolio gallery
- Contact information
- Social media links
- Commission availability

### 4. Gallery View Implementation

Enhance the dashboard with a gallery view optimized for visual content:

- Grid layout with adjustable density
- Filtering by category, medium, price range
- Sort options (newest, popular, price)
- Quick preview on hover
- Lazy loading for performance

### 5. Art Detail Page

Create a dedicated page for individual artworks with:

- High-quality preview
- Artwork details (medium, dimensions, etc.)
- Artist information
- Purchase options
- Related works

### 6. Purchase Functionality

Implement a secure purchase system using blockchain for ownership transfer:

1. **Smart Contract Integration**: Extend current contracts to handle ownership transfer
2. **Payment Processing**: Integrate cryptocurrency payment options
3. **Ownership Records**: Store ownership history on blockchain
4. **Royalty Support**: Implement royalty payments for secondary sales

```typescript
// Example purchase function
const purchaseArtwork = async (contentId: number, price: string) => {
  // 1. Verify artwork is for sale
  // 2. Process payment
  // 3. Transfer ownership on blockchain
  // 4. Update database records
  // 5. Notify seller and buyer
};
```

### 7. Artist-specific Features

Implement features tailored to different creator types:

- **Traditional Artists**: Physical shipping information, certificate of authenticity
- **Photographers**: Licensing options, usage rights
- **UI/UX Designers**: Figma integration, prototype previews
- **Digital Artists**: Download options, file formats

### 8. Discovery and Search

Enhance content discovery with:

- Advanced search with filters
- Recommendation engine
- Featured artists section
- Trending artworks
- Collections and curated galleries

### 9. Social and Community Features

Build community engagement with:

- Follow artists functionality
- Like and comment on artworks
- Share to social media
- Collections and favorites

### 10. Analytics for Artists

Provide insights to artists with:

- View statistics
- Engagement metrics
- Sales reports
- Audience demographics
